    <h1>Bio Of Myself:</h1>
    <img src ="IMG_5413.jpg" alt="Profile photo" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left: 15px;">
    <p>My name is Raees, I am a 20 year old that had no idea what i wanted to study until i found more about software engineering
       it is something that i really started to enjoy and i want to make a career out of it.</p>
    <p>I have around 4 and half months experience in coding and its been the best time i have ever spent doing work.</p>
    <p>Ironically my passion is probably cars and coding is the polar opposite!. Somthing that motivates me is that hard work always pays off.
       this was said by my parents and i would like to make them and myself proud.</p>
